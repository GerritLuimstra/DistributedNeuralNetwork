        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>
         Welcome to the DNN website. We are a group composed of six University students who decided to take on a crazy task for one of our University projects. This website will explain everything to you, from why we decided to do this, our goals with the project. What we hope to accomplish with our work and who we all are. I hope you enjoy and take a look at what we've done!

        <h2>What is our project?</h2>
        <p>
          The project is based on Neural Networks. The initial idea is to be able to increase the spead in which a Neural Network learns through an inexpensive method. One of our end goals for the project is to be able to have a fully functioning Neural Network which is capable of analyzing lung x-rays and determine with a high percentage of accuracy if the the patient has pneumonia or not. If you want to find out more then click on the "Further information" tag on the top right of the website.

		    <h3>Important information!</h3>
		    <p>
          If you don't know anything about Neural Networks then don't worry. We have a video that can explain everything to you. Click on the "Beginner" tag on the top right of website.
