				<h2>Four benefits of Artifical Neural Networks</h2>
				<h3>Organic learning</h3>
				<p>
					Neural Networks are capable of learning beyond what it is given. A Neural Networks outputs aren't limited by the inputs that it was given. Neural Networks are capable of generelazing their inputs, this is very important for pattern recognition system.
				</p>
				<h3>Nonlinear data processing</h3>
				<p>
					Nonlinear systems are capable of making shortcuts for large solutions. This is important for commercial big-data analysis as it cuts analysis time therefore reducing the overall cost and increasing profits. 
				</p>
				<h3>Fault tolerance</h3>
				<p>
					Neural Networks are capable of working arond missing data and nodes that don't work.
				</p>
				<h3>Self repair</h3>
				<p>
					When a Neural Network is asked to find out information from a set of information from a set of data that is no longer working, the Neural Network is capable of running a self diagonis on the problem. Therefore fixing the issue and answering the request.
