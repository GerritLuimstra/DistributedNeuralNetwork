				<h2>A basic introduction to Neural Networks</h2>
				<h3>"A Neural Network is a computer system modelled on the human brain and nervous system" - DNN</h3>
				<p>
					So, what is a Neural Network? Firstly, "Neural Networs" get their name from the neurons that are in our brain.  A neuron is compromised of dendrines, cell body and the axon terminals. In simple terms, one neuron will take inputs from other neurons through dendrines. What we want to focus on is an Artifical Neuron which is the heart of a Neural Network. The neuron of an articial neural network is called the "activiatoin node" this is where everything is going to be happening.

				<h2>Four benefits of Artifical Neural Networks</h2>
				<h3>Organic learning</h3>
				<p>
					Neural Networks are capable of learning beyond what it is given. A Neural Networks outputs aren't limited by the inputs that it was given. Neural Networks are capable of generelazing their inputs, this is very important for pattern recognition system.
				</p>
				<h3>Nonlinear data processing</h3>
				<p>
					Nonlinear systems are capable of making shortcuts for large solutions. This is important for commercial big-data analysis as it cuts analysis time therefore reducing the overall cost and increasing profits. 
				</p>
				<h3>Fault tolerance</h3>
				<p>
					Neural Networks are capable of working arond missing data and nodes that don't work.
				</p>
				<h3>Self repair</h3>
				<p>
					When a Neural Network is asked to find out information from a set of information from a set of data that is no longer working, the Neural Network is capable of running a self diagonis on the problem. Therefore fixing the issue and answering the request.
