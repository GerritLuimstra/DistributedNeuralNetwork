				<h2>A basic introduction to Neural Networks</h2>
				<h3>"A Neural Network is a computer system modelled on the human brain and nervous system" - DNN</h3>
				<hr>

				<h4>What is a Neural Network?</h4>
				<p>
					So, what is a Neural Network? Firstly, "Neural Networks" get their name from the neurons that are in our brain.  A neuron is compromised of dendrines, cell body and the axon terminals. In simple terms, one neuron will take inputs from other neurons through dendrines. What we want to focus on is an Artifical Neuron which is the heart of a Neural Network. The neuron of an articial neural network is called the "activiatoin node", this is where everything happens. 
				</p>

				<h4>How does a Neural Network work?</h4>
				<p>
					Once the Neural Network has been trained with enough learning examples you can give it completely new inputs and you will be able to see how it'll respond. For example, imagine you have been feeding your Neural Network images of cats and dogs and while this is happening you are able to tell it which one is a cat and which one is a dog. After a sufficient amount of run throughs you can feed it a picture of a lion and see what happens. Your Neural Network will use what you've taugt it to register this image as either a cat or a dog. 
				</p>

				<h4>Why do people use Neural Networks?</h4>
				<p>
					Neural Networks can be used in business and be implemented in areas such as accountaing or financial analysis. Another area in which Neural Networks can be used for in the field of business is resrouce allocation or scheduling. Neural Networks can also be used in other fields such as medicine, marketing etc....

				<h3>Input Layer</h3>
				<p>
					The input layer passes the data directly to the first hidden layer where the data is multiplied by the first hidden layers weights.
				</p>
				<h3>Hidden Layer</h3>
				<p>
					The hidden layer transforms the inputs into something that the output layer can use.
				</p>
				<h3>Output Layer</h3>
				<p>
					The output layer receives all of the information and produces the end result. This end result being whatever you set the Neural Networks task to be.
